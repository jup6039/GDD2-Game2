  dialogue:
  - Walking past the local comic book store, you see a familiar yet unexpected figure
    step out of the store, holding a plastic bag filled with comic books.
  - "It\u2019s Superman Jones, the popular, upperclassman leader of the football team.
    As your gaze meets his, a look of recognition flashes in his eyes, and he suddenly
    stumbles but catches himself before falling, stiffly standing up straight and
    trying to hide the plastic bag behind him."
  - "\"Gyah! Uh, heyyyyy, you\u2026kid from school. What, uh\u2026 What\u2019s up?\""
  - '"Superman? What are you doing here?"'
  - "\"Oh, y\u2019know, just...waiting for my little bro Naruto. We\u2019re supposed
    to buy comics together today! Yeah, that's it...\""
  - OPTION 1
  - '"Oh, these? I, uh...bought them for Naruto!"'
  - OPTION 1-1
  - '"Wha- Lying? What do you mean? Why would I do that?"'
  - '"You said you were going to buy comic books with Naruto, but it looks like you
    already bought comic books. Then, you said that you bought them for Naruto. That''s
    two different stories." '
  - "\"Oh, um, I meant that I was waiting for Naruto, but he was taking a while to
    show up, so...I decided to go ahead and just buy the comics for him. Yeah, that\u2019s
    what I meant!\""
  - You look at Superman for a moment, inquisitively
  - "\"Actually, I should go look for Naruto and give him his comics. He\u2019s probably
    really excited to read them. So, um...later!\""
  - He turns away quickly and runs down the street, hugging the plastic bag
  - OPTION 1-2
  - '"Okay, I guess. So, do you have plans for Halloween?"'
  - "\"Not really. I\u2019m too old for Halloween anyway.\" Superman looks sad for
    a moment, before his smile widens once again. \"I might just go to a party with
    my friends or something.\""
  - '"Nobody is too old for Halloween!"'
  - "\"Right, sure\u2026 Um, anyway, I actually gotta go. Later.\""
  - He turns and walks away, still trying to hide the plastic bag from you.
  - OPTION 2
  - "He seems to relax a bit. \"Naruto\u2019s doing great! He\u2019s been busy working
    on his costume for Halloween, and he\u2019s really excited about it. He\u2019s
    come a long way from his makeshift costumes back in elementary school. I\u2019m
    pretty proud of him. Plus, it\u2019s just nice to see him happy for once.\""
  - OPTION 2-1
  - "\"Hehe, thanks! I really try. It\u2019s hard trying to get him to open up, even
    for me. But deep down, he\u2019s a cool guy. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s my brother.
    He fidgets with the plastic bag. Speaking of which, I should probably...go look
    for him. It was nice talking with you. See you around!\""
  - Superman turns and waves as he walks away, still trying to hide the plastic bag.
  - OPTION 2-2
  - "\"I...don\u2019t have a costume.\" He looks away and frowns slightly. \"I\u2019m
    too old for Halloween.\" "
  - "He looks back at you and forces a grin. \"It\x19s fine, though. I can still hang
    with my friends. Which reminds me, I need to go meet up with them. See ya around.\""
  - You wave goodbye, and he waves back as he walks away.
  - SCENE 0 -----------------------------
  - At the end of the school day, you recognize an upperclassman waiting outside the
    school building.
  - It's Superman Jones, the captain of the football team and the most popular student
    at school.
  - Wouldn't it be cool if I got the Superman Jones to go trick-or-treating with me?
    You think to yourself.
  - Suddenly, he turns to look in your direction and waves you over. You freeze and
    gulp before approaching him.
  - Superman Jones wants to talk to you?!
  - '"Hey, sorry, have you seen Naruto?"'
  - '"Naruto?"'
  - '"Yeah, my younger brother. You''re in his class, right?"'
  - You snap out of your nervousness and realize that Superman didn't actually want
    to talk to you; he just wanted to know where his brother was.
  - You're a bit relieved but also disappointed.
  - '"He''s at his locker, still packing his books."'
  - '"Oh okay, thanks!"'
  - He gives you a friendly pat on the shoulder before heading back into the school.
  - As you watch him walk away, you wonder if you really could somehow convince Superman
    to go trick-or-treating with you.

  - SCENE 0 ----------------
  - As you exit the lunchline with your tray, you look around the cafeteria. You spot
    the table you normally sit at with your friend, but today it's more empty than
    usual.
  - You really don't want to sit alone, so you look around to some of the other tables.
    Many of them are full, but you do notice an empty seat at the table where Cindy
    Umbrella sits.
  - 'Maybe you should sit with her! You do need to make some new friends fast, and
    who better than the daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town. You quickly
    make your way over to the table and take a seat. '
  - "C-\u2026"
  - "P-\u2026 Uh, hi!"
  - C-Can I help you?
  - P-Well, yeah. I was wondering if you wanted to be friends.
  - 'Cindy pauses for a moment, looking almost shocked at the question. A few moments
    later, as more of her friends arrive at the table, she begins laughing. '
  - C-Hahaha. Friends? With you? Please.
  - "P-But\u2026"
  - "C-Ahem. I believe my friend had reserved that seat, so if you don\u2019t mind\u2026 "
  - "Disheartened, you grab your tray and get up from the table, letting one of Cindy\u2019s
    other friends take the seat. As you walk away, she seems to follow you with her
    gaze."
  - You look back, but she quickly turns her head away and starts a conversation with
    the other girls at the table. Weird, for a moment she looked almost regretful.
  - SCENE 1 --------------
  - 'After another long day of school, you head back to your locker, ready to pack
    up your stuff and head home. However, as you are walking down the hallway, some
    upperclassman shoulders you, sending you backing up into Cindy. She drops some
    of the notebooks and looks at you angrily. '
  - "C-Hey, watch where you\u2019re going, you ne\u2019er-do-well! You could have
    knocked me over."
  - "P-I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to, I\u2026"
  - "C-What if I were holding a cup of coffee, or a precious glass statuette. I could\u2019ve
    been injured, or had my property destroyed. Maybe you should look\u2026 "
  - As she continues to tell you off, a boy walks towards you from down the hall.
    It is Annelius Charming, another one of the rich kids of the town. As he approaches,
    Cindy trails off and turns to him.
  - A-Hi there, Cindy. I was just wondering if you wanted to go trick or treating
    with me this Friday. What do you say?
  - 'Cindy immediately freezes, and begins looking around nervously. '
  - "C-Uh, right, trick or treating. Halloween,. Uh ... I can\u2019t. Yeah, I can\u2019t,
    sorry. I already promised to go trick or treating with \u2026 with them! She points
    at you."
  - "A-Really? You\u2019re going trick or treating with \u2026 them?"
  - He looks at you, studying your face intently.
  - OPTION 1
  - P-Uh, yeah. We were just talking about the route we want to take through town.
    We got a little heated, I guess. Haha.
  - Annelius-Whatever. See you later, Cindy.
  - 'Cindy: She lets out a sigh. Whew, that was a close one. Thanks for the assist.'
  - OPTION 1-1
  - 'Player: That was kind of weird. What was that all about?'
  - "Cindy: Oh him? That\u2019s Annelius. His parents are closely associated with
    mine, so he hangs around pretty often. He\u2019s really dull, and quite annoying."
  - "Player: Why\u2019d you have to lie to him? Why didn\u2019t you just say no."
  - 'Cindy: How I deal with pests is none of your concern, unless you keep wasting
    my precious time with pointless questions. '
  - 'Cindy stoops down to pick up the books she dropped. '
  - 'Player: I really am sorry about that. It was an accident. '
  - "Cindy: Don\u2019t worry about it. Just watch where you\u2019re going next time."
  - She turns from you and heads towards the exit.
  - OPTION 1-2
  - 'Player: So, are we really going trick or treating together?'
  - "Cindy: What? Oh, no. Of course not. I mean, you helped me out, but that doesn\u2019t
    mean you\u2019re, like, automatically my friend."
  - "Player: But I helped you out, right? That\u2019s gotta be worth something."
  - "Cindy: Cindy narrows her eyes, then smiles briefly. I suppose so. Let\u2019s
    just say I, like, owe you one, or something."
  - Cindy picks up her books and walks down the hall towards the door.
  - OPTION 2
  - "Annelius: \u2026 Riiiiight. Real talkative partner, Cindy. Well, see you later,
    I guess."
  - "Cindy: She lets out a sigh. Whew, that was a close one. You could\u2019ve helped
    a little."
  - OPTION 2-1
  - 'Player: That was kind of weird. What was that all about?'
  - "Cindy: That\u2019s none of your business. You don\u2019t need to concern yourself
    with my family\u2019s choice in acquaintances. "
  - 'Cindy stoops down to pick up the books she dropped. '
  - 'Player: I really am sorry about that. It was an accident. '
  - 'Cindy: Whatever. Just try not to be so oblivious in the future. You can be a
    real menace to those around you.'
  - OPTION 2-2
  - 'Player: So, are we really going trick or treating together? '
  - "Cindy: What? Oh, no. Of course not. I can\u2019t be seen frolicking about on
    Halloween with someone like you.  "
  - 'Player: But you just said... '
  - 'Cindy: It was a lie, obviously. It was pretty convenient that you were here,
    really saved me from an...interesting situation. Anyway, bye now. '
  - 'Cindy closes her locker, picks up her dropped books, and turns away from you,
    walking down the hallway. '
  - SCENE 2 -----------
  - 'As you walk down the street, you notice Cindy on the other side of the road.
    Looking both ways, you quickly cross the street and walk up to her. After a moment
    of recognition, she looks at you, mildly annoyed.  '
  - "Cindy: Oh, it\u2019s you. What do you want? "
  - "Player: I was just walking and saw you, so I thought I\u2019d pop over and say
    hi. What\u2019re you up to? "
  - "Cindy: I was out for a walk. I need to get my daily 30 minutes of exercise, and
    think that the silence of the town\u2019s afternoon lull is rather calming. At
    least it was. So do you need something, or are you just here to waste more of
    my time? "
  - OPTION 1
  - 'Cindy: Sigh. I thought we were on the same page here. It was just a white lie
    to get Annelius out of my hair. '
  - 'Player: No, I know, I was just wondering if you had plans for the day. What are
    you dressing up as? '
  - "Cindy: Of course I have plans. I\u2019m going trick or treating around the neighborhood;
    the more festive parts, anyway. And I\u2019m dressing up like a Pretty Princess,
    as always. The look fits me quite well. What about you? No doubt taping a bunch
    of cardboard to yourself and calling it a robot costume. Anyway, are we done here? "
  - 'Player: Wait. You still owe me one for helping you out yesterday, remember? '
  - "Cindy: Right, well Halloween\u2019s a little out of scope.  "
  - 'Player. Yeah, I figured. I was more interested in asking if you wanted to hang
    out for the day? '
  - "Cindy: Hang out? With you? Well, I guess it can\u2019t be TOO awful. Besides,
    an Umbrella always keeps her word. But we\u2019re even after this, got it? "
  - "Player: Haha, no question. I\u2019ve got just the place in mind. "
  - OPTION 2
  - "Cindy: Well, I had a rather busy day ahead of me, but I guess I\u2019m gonna
    have to push that back. It doesn\u2019t seem like this conversation\u2019s going
    to end any time soon. "
  - 'Player: Haha, well actually I asked on account of the favor you owe me? '
  - 'Cindy: Favor? '
  - 'Player: You know, from helping you deal with Annelius the other day. '
  - 'Cindy: Right, right, yes...that. Well, what did you have in mind.  '
  - 'Player:  I was wondering if you wanted to hang out for the day? '
  - "Cindy: Hang out? With you? Well, I guess it can\u2019t be TOO awful. Besides,
    an Umbrella always keeps her word. But we\u2019re even after this, got it? "
  - "Player: Haha, no question. I\u2019ve got just the place in mind. "
  - PICK UP SCENE HERE
  - 'After a few minutes of walking, you and Cindy enter into the arcade. You have
    spent a lot of your time playing the games here, and although she tries to hide
    it, you catch a look of recognition from Cindy as she eyes some of the games. '
  - "Cindy: Ah, the arcade. I...haven\u2019t had much experience with such trivial
    activities, but it\u2019s not the worst place in the world to end up. So? Where
    shall we start. "
  - 'For the next few hours, you and Cindy play arcade games together. She is surprisingly
    good at some of the games you play, despite claiming that she had never seen them
    before. As you spend time together, you have the opportunity to ask some questions. '
  - OPTION 1
  - 'Cindy: You want to know about my family?  '
  - "Player: Yeah. I\u2019ve always seen them around the town, but they\u2019re usually
    in their limo. I\u2019ve never really gotten close. They seem so mysterious. "
  - "Cindy: Oooh, mysterious, huh? Well don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re just as normal
    as anyone else. Well, except for the fact that they\u2019re rich. They always
    act differently when they\u2019re around their friends. It\u2019s...kind of strange. "
  - "Player: Yeah weird. Can\u2019t imagine what that would be like\u2026 "
  - 'Cindy falls quiet for a moment, and as you look over at her, she seems almost
    sad. An awkward silence ensues. '
  - OPTION 1-1
  - 'Player: Uh...are you okay. '
  - "Cindy: What...oh, yeah I\u2019m fine. Just, uh, thinking about...stuff. Don\u2019t
    worry about me, focus on the game. I\u2019m kicking your butt! "
  - OPTION 1-2
  - 'Player: Uh...so, do you have any siblings? '
  - "Cindy: Huh...siblings? No, it\u2019s just me. My parents often say that, being
    an only child, I\u2019ll have to inherit their business one day. They expect me
    to be ready to take on the mantle when I\u2019m older. It\u2019s...kind of a lot
    of pressure.  "
  - OPTION 2
  - "Player: So, what\u2019s it like living in your house. It\u2019s huge, like 4
    times the size of mine. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like. "
  - "Cindy: Yeah, I guess you\u2019d want to know what it\u2019s like living on such
    a large estate. It\u2019s understandable, really. I often catch people out the
    window staring in awe. It\u2019s really a sight to behold. Inside\u2019s just
    as lavish as the outside, I\u2019ll have you know. Designer carpets, drapes, sofas;
    everything you\u2019d expect from the richest family in the town. "
  - "Player: That\u2019s crazy. You must have, like, so many video games, huh? "
  - "Cindy: Video games? No, we don\u2019t have anything of that sort. My dad says
    \u201Cit\u2019s not befitting of a young lady of my stature.\u201D "
  - OPTION 2-1
  - 'Cindy: ...Yeah. With such a large house, and parents who are pretty distracted
    with their work it can get pretty lonely. '
  - "Player: I\u2019m sorry. Well...if you ever need someone to spend time with or
    talk to about that, I\u2019ll be around "
  - 'Cindy looks over at you and smiles '
  - "Cindy: Thanks. I\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll let you know. "
  - OPTION 2-2
  - 'Cindy: W-what? Me, sneak out? What kind of girl do you think I am? '
  - 'Player: Sorry, just wondering. You seem pretty good at these games. '
  - "Cindy: Hmph. Well sorry if I\u2019m just naturally talented. "
  - OPTION 3
  - 'Player: So, how exactly did your family get rich?  '
  - "Cindy: Well, if you\u2019re so interested in my family\u2019s wealth, I suppose
    I could tell you. My parents used to tell me this story when they were kids. My
    mother\u2019s grandfather and his wife lived here, in this very town. They noticed
    that it was very rainy around here, and that no one had any way of shielding themselves
    from the rain. Seeing the people in anguish, they were determined to make things
    right. They slaved away until they were able to produce a light, portable, and
    stylish shield to block the rain.  "
  - 'Player: They made umbrellas? '
  - 'Cindy: Not just any normal umbrella. Stylish umbrellas. Patented Umbrella Brand
    umbrellas. '
  - 'Player: Huh. Right. '
  - 'Cindy: Yeah, I always thought it was a silly story.'
  - OPTION 3-1
  - "Player: I mean, it is a pretty dumb story. Obviously your great grandparents
    didn\u2019t invent umbrellas.  "
  - "Cindy: Haha, yeah. I don\u2019t really know why my parents insisted on telling
    me that story when I was younger. Even then it was unbelievable. Maybe it makes
    them feel good about themselves or something. "
  - "Player: Forgetting the story, it\u2019s still pretty remarkable that your family
    got so wealthy just from selling umbrellas. "
  - 'Cindy: Yeah, it makes more sense if you just suspend your disbelief. '
  - OPTION 3-2
  - "Player: Wow, I can\u2019t believe that your grandparents invented the first umbrellas
    to ever be used in this town. "
  - "Cindy: Haha, yeah...you\u2019re kidding right. "
  - 'Player: What? Haha, yeah, of course. Me. Kidding. Obviously. '
  - 'Cindy: Yeah. Right. '
  - PICK UP SCENE HERE
  - 'After spending an hour or so at the arcade, you run out of coins and unfortunately
    have to leave. '
  - "Cindy: Well, that was...more fun than expected. I guess you can be pretty good
    company. When you\u2019re not being petty and annoying, I mean. "
  - 'Player: Haha, I guess so. '
  - "Cindy: I should probably be heading home now. Don\u2019t wanna be late for dinner. "
  - 'Player: Goodnight. See you at school tomorrow. '
  - SCENE 3 ------------------
  - HIGH FRIENDSHIP - ------------------
  - "Later in the afternoon, you head on over to Cindy\u2019s house. You had a good
    time hanging out with her yesterday, and wanted to follow up with her. You knock
    on her door, and eventually she answers. "
  - 'Cindy: Oh, hey. What are you doing here? '
  - 'Player: Hey Cindy. I had a lot of fun at the arcade the other day, and was wondering
    if you wanted to head back there again sometime. '
  - "Cindy: Keep your voice down, my parents could hear you. Look, I had fun hanging
    out with you too, but you shouldn\u2019t be here. May parents could ... "
  - "Before she could finish, you are both surprised as you hear a voice from behind
    you. It\u2019s Annelius, the boy from before. "
  - "Annelius. Hey there Cindy. And...who are you again? Oh right. You\u2019re the
    kid from the other side of town. "
  - 'Cindy: Do you need anything Annelius.  '
  - "Annelius: Just checking in to see if your plans for Halloween had changed, but
    clearly\u2026 "
  - "Cindy: Uh, nope, no change of plans as of yet. Sorry Annelius, guess you\u2019ll
    have to try again next year. "
  - "Annelius: Why are you going trick or treating with him, anyway, Cindy? You should
    be going with someone from your neighborhood, someone around here. Not this loser.
    Do your parents know you\u2019ve been hanging out with them? Annelius turns toward
    you. Get lost, dweeb. She shouldn\u2019t be hanging out with you anyway. "
  - OPTION 1
  - "Player: No. You shouldn\u2019t be making decisions for her. She should be able
    to choose who she wants to spend time with, or where she wants to spend that time. "
  - 'Cindy flashes you a wide smile as Annelius scowls at you. '
  - "Annelius: What, you think you know what\u2019s best for her? "
  - 'Player: No, I think she does. '
  - 'Annelius: Annelius looks from you to Cindy, then back to you. Whatever. You two
    go trick or treating all you want. '
  - "Cindy: Wow...thank you. I\u2019ve never really had anyone stand up for me like
    that. Sometimes, I wish I could say the same thing to my parents. But they\u2019d
    be so disappointed. "
  - OPTION 1-1
  - 'Player: What do you mean? Why would they be disappointed? '
  - "Cindy: What? I said that out loud? Sorry, you weren\u2019t supposed to hear that. "
  - "Player: It\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t tell anyone. You can talk to me. "
  - "Cindy: I don\u2019t hate my parents. Not by any means. It\u2019s just...being
    their only child, they expect a lot out of me. They\u2019re always telling me
    how I\u2019m going to inherit the company some day. They say I need to keep up
    my outward appearance to fit the woman that I will grow into. But what if that\u2019s
    not what I want. What if I just want to be a normal girl, who doesn\u2019t have
    to worry about her appearance, or who she hangs out with, or her future reputation?
    \ "
  - "Player: Yeah, that makes sense. I can\u2019t imagine being forced into such rigid
    boundaries. So why don\u2019t you just tell them how you feel? "
  - "Cindy: No, I couldn\u2019t. They\u2019d hate me. "
  - "Player: Cindy\u2026 "
  - 'You hear a voice call from within the house. After a moment, Cindy turns back
    to you. '
  - "Cindy: I\u2019ve got to go, sorry. See you around. "
  - OPTION 1-2
  - "Player: What\u2019s his problem? "
  - "Cindy: Annelius? I don\u2019t really know. When his family moved to town last
    year, they quickly became friends with mine. I guess he felt that our parents\u2019
    friendship meant that he had to be friends with me too. But I always found him
    annoying. "
  - "Player: Yeah, can\u2019t disagree with you there. Why don\u2019t you just tell
    him how you feel and ask him to leave you alone.  "
  - "Cindy: Well - I don\u2019t know. My parents like the Charmings. If I were to
    outright reject their son, I don\u2019t know how they would react. They expect
    a lot from me, and I don\u2019t want to disappoint them. "
  - 'Player: That sounds like a lot of pressure. '
  - "Cindy: Yeah\u2026 "
  - 'You hear a voice call from within the house. After a moment, Cindy turns back
    to you. '
  - "Cindy: I\u2019ve got to go, sorry. See you around. "
  - OPTION 2
  - "Player: No. I can go wherever I want, and spend time with whoever I want. You
    don\u2019t control me. "
  - 'Annelius scowls at you. '
  - "Annelius: What are you, some kind of tough guy? You want to go trick or treating
    with them? Then go ahead. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you when your parents
    find out. "
  - "Cindy: Wow. Sorry about him, he was even more of a jerk than usual. And...sorry
    if I was ever like that. Lately, I\u2019ve begun to realize that I\u2019ve been
    a little quick to judge people. "
  - OPTION 2-1
  - "Player: What\u2019s his problem? "
  - "Cindy: Annelius? I don\u2019t really know. When his family moved to town last
    year, they quickly became friends with mine. I guess he felt that our parents\u2019
    friendship meant that he had to be friends with me too. But I always found him
    annoying. "

  - 'You hear a voice call from within the house. After a moment, Cindy turns back
    to you. '
  - "Cindy: I\u2019ve got to go, sorry. See you around. "
  - OPTION 2-2
  - "Player: Hey, don\u2019t worry about it. So, do you have any plans for tomorrow?"
  - "Cindy: Right, the arcade. I would like to, but unfortunately I have my family\u2019s
    Autumbrella Event. It\u2019s the biggest festival for Umbrella umbrellas, where
    we show off our designs for next season. I-I can\u2019t miss it. Sorry. "
  - "Player: That\u2019s alright. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by. I\u2019ve always seen the
    signs in the park, but I just assumed it was a bunch of old people geeking out
    over umbrellas."
  - "Cindy: Haha, that\u2019s pretty much it. It\u2019s not very exciting so, uh,
    there\u2019s really no reason to stop by.  "
  - 'You hear a voice call from within the house. After a moment, Cindy turns back
    to you. '
  - "Cindy: I\u2019ve got to go, sorry. See you around. "
  - LOW FRIENDSHIP --------------
  - "As you\u2019re out walking on the street, you see Cindy leaving the general store
    with a group of friends, a plastic bag in her hand. You walk up to her. "
  - "Player: Hey Cindy, what\u2019s up.  "
  - 'Cindy: Oh, you again.  '
  - 'Player: I was just wondering if you wanted to hang out again sometime tonight.
    Just got my allowance, so we could play at least 3 more rounds of Marvel vs Capcom. '
  - 'Cindy: What? And why would I want to do that? '
  - 'Player: Well...I just thought after yesterday...  '
  - 'Cindy: What, that I would be suddenly swayed into being your friend? I told you
    yesterday, we were even after that. '
  - "Player: But\u2026 "
  - "Cindy\u2019s Friends: Cindy, come on, we should get going. "
  - 'Cindy turns to her friends, and says something to them as they walk away. You
    hear someone walking up to you from behind. You turn to find Annelius standing
    there. '
  - "Annelius: Ouch. Sorry bro, that\u2019s gotta hurt. "
  - 'Player: I thought we had fun together yesterday, but I guess not.  '
  - "Annelius: I don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019re just not cool enough. "
  - 'Player: Not cool enough? '
  - "Annelius: Yeah. Your cool status is real important to us upstanding kids in the
    rich part of town. If you want to hang with Cindy, you gotta prove you\u2019re
    cool.  "
  - 'Player: Well, how can I do that? '
  - 'Annelius: Hm, good question. Lemme think...Oh, I know! You should pull a prank
    on her. '
  - 'Player: A prank? That sounds kinda mean. '
  - "Annelius: What? Nah, on our side of town we do it all the time. It\u2019s a way
    to show how cool you are. She got me pretty good a few days ago. I was planning
    one for tomorrow, during her family\u2019s Autumbrella Festival in the park. They
    always show off their new designer umbrellas for the upcoming year, and they usually
    have her say something to the crowd. It would be the perfect chance to pull a
    prank. "
  - 'Player: Are you sure? '
  - "Annelius: Yeah, for sure. She\u2019ll think it\u2019s hilarious, and then she\u2019ll
    be totally down to hang. Meet me at the park tomorrow, I\u2019ll fill you in then. "
  - SCENE 4 ---------------
  - HIGH FRIENDSHIP ----------------
  - 'As you walk through the park, you see umbrellas and Umbrellas everywhere you
    look. Eventually, you find the Umbrella you are looking for, as you spy Cindy
    sitting on a park bench talking with one of your teachers. She is holding a designer
    umbrella with an intricate jack-o-lantern on it. When she is done talking, you
    approach her. '
  - "Cindy: Oh, hey. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see you here.  "
  - "Player: Yeah, I got pretty bored, so I figured I\u2019d stop by. "
  - 'Cindy: You got so bored that you saw an umbrella festival and thought it sounded
    fun? '
  - 'Player: Haha apparently. '
  - OPTION 1
  - 'Player: So. The Autumbrella Festival. What exactly is this thing again.'
  - "Cindy: Well, every year Umbrella umbrellas produces a new line of designer umbrellas,
    starting with unique autumn designs. So every Halloween we show off our new designs
    at this festival. And my parents always make me come, and carry a stupid umbrella
    even though it\u2019s so windy I feel like I\u2019m gonna be swept away. And they
    always make me give a speech. I never have anything to talk about, so I just say
    something dumb about how much I like umbrellas. It usually gets a round of applause. "
  - "Player: If you hate it so much, why don\u2019t you just leave? Go do something
    you enjoy? "
  - "Cindy: What? No, I couldn\u2019t do that. My parents want me here, they think
    it\u2019s important that I see how the business gets done, you know. "
  - OPTION 2
  - "Player: I haven\u2019t seen your parents around. They\u2019re somewhere around
    here, right? "
  - 'Cindy points to the large mass of people at the center of the park '
  - "Cindy: Yeah, they\u2019re somewhere in that mass of people. They\u2019re probably
    signing umbrellas or something. "
  - "Player: Cool. So, I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re forcing to be here, huh? "
  - 'Cindy: What? What makes you say that? '
  - "Player: Oh, I don\u2019t know, something about the way you called the festival
    boring earlier.  "
  - "Cindy: Fair enough. Yeah, I never really liked the Autumbrella Festival. It\u2019s
    just a bunch of people with umbrellas. It\u2019s not even raining. Or sunny. There
    is no reason to carry around umbrellas, and yet here we are. It\u2019s kind of
    dumb. "
  - "Player: If you hate it so much, why don\u2019t you just leave? Go do something
    you enjoy? "
  - "Cindy: What? No, I couldn\u2019t do that. My parents want me here, they think
    it\u2019s important that I see how the business gets done, you know. "
  - SCENE MEETS UP HERE
  - OPTION 1
  - DEFENDED CINDY
  - 'Player: But what about what you said the other day? About wanting to stand up
    to your parents. Are you really going to let them control you your whole life.
    Or are you going to be your own person.  '
  - "Cindy: You know what? You\u2019re right. I can be whoever I want. I don\u2019t
    need to mindlessly obey them. And if they\u2019re disappointed in me, well...
    I guess I\u2019ll just have to deal with that. "
  - NOT DEFENDED
  - 'Player: Are you going to let them control you your whole life? '
  - 'Cindy: What else am I supposed to do? '
  - 'Player: You could tell them how you feel. You could ditch this festival and do
    your own thing. '
  - "Cindy: Leave them here? No way, you\u2019re crazy. They\u2019d be so disappointed
    in me. I couldn\u2019t do that to them. "
  - 'Player: Are you sure? '
  - 'Cindy: Yeah. But, I have thought about trick or treating later, and decided that
    I want to give you a chance to prove your trick or treating prowess. Who knows,
    maybe you have a better route than the one I normally take. '
  - OPTION 2
  - "Cindy: Yeah. As much as I want to leave this boring event, they want me here.
    And I don\u2019t want to disappoint them.  "
  - "Player: I\u2019m sorry they make you do stuff like this.  "
  - "Cindy: Hey, at least this year it wasn\u2019t SO boring to drive away all the
    kids. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever had an interesting conversation at
    one of these. "
  - "Player: Hey, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. Well, I should probably get
    home. "
  - 'Cindy: Wait. This festival only goes on for another hour, so I should be able
    to, you know, go trick or treating after this. '
  - 'Player: Really? I thought you had other plans? '
  - "Cindy: Well, I always go trick or treating with the same people every year. Maybe
    it\u2019s time I changed it up. "
  - LOW FRIENDSHIP ----------------
  - 'As you walk through the park, you see umbrellas and Umbrellas everywhere you
    look. Eventually, you catch site of Cindy sitting on a park bench near the road,
    as well as Annelius, who beckons you from behind a tent.  '
  - "Annelius: Alright, so here\u2019s the plan. There, on the far end of the park,
    is the stage where Cindy will be giving her short speech. I already set up a bucket
    full of water above the stage."
  - "A-All I need you to do is to use this sling to knock it down while she\u2019s
    giving her speech. She\u2019ll get soaked, we\u2019ll all have a good laugh, and
    then we\u2019ll go trick or treating together later. "
  - OPTION 1
  - 'Annelius hands you a sling and a stone. '
  - "Annelius: Make sure you hit it before she\u2019s done with her speech. "
  - "Player: Right. I won\u2019t mess this up, don\u2019t worry. "
  - "You continue to hang around the festival, making sure to try and avoid Cindy.
    Eventually, everyone quiets down, and you see Cindy\u2019s dad walk out on the
    stage. He briefly thanks everyone for coming out and talks about the upcoming
    line of designer umbrellas. Then, he welcomes Cindy on to the stage to give a
    short speech.  "
  - 'Cindy takes the center of the stage, and then begins talking about how much she
    likes umbrellas. You lift up the sling and aim the stone towards the bucket suspended
    above her head. '
  - OPTION 1-1
  - 'You release the stone, and the bucket tips, sending water cascading over Cindy.
    Now soaked, she looks out at you, furious. There is an awkward silence, until
    finally Annelius stands up and walks towards the stage.  '
  - 'Annelius: Cindy, are you okay?  '
  - 'Cindy: Yeah, just a little cold and wet. She glares at you. What the hell is
    wrong with you? '
  - 'Player: What? It was just a fun prank, right Annelius? '
  - "Annelius: You\u2019re messed up, you know that. Come on, Cindy, I can walk you
    home. "
  - "Player: But...but\u2026 "
  - OPTION 1-2
  - "You look up at the bucket, but can\u2019t bring yourself to be so mean to Cindy.
    You lower the sling and look back at Annelius. He looks at you angrily, and then
    raises another sling, taking aim at the bucket. "
  - "You don\u2019t have enough time to shout out. You have to act. You run towards
    the stage, grabbing an umbrella from one of the display stands nearby. You open
    the umbrella and hold it above Cindy\u2019s head just in time, as the water cascades
    over the designer rain shield. "
  - 'Cindy: What are you doing? '
  - "Player: Saving you from Annelius\u2019s prank. I\u2019m sorry, I almost let him
    go through with this.  "
  - "You fill Cindy and her parents in on Annelius\u2019s plan, and your role in the
    prank. His parents scold him for the prank, while your parents scold you for going
    along with it. However, Cindy is grateful for your help, and decides that she
    will go trick or treating with you as a thank you. "
  - OPTION 2
  - 'Player: Uh, right. Sure. '
  - 'Annelius hands you a sling and a stone, but you have no intention of using it.
    As soon as you are out of earshot from Annelius, you immediately head to Cindy. '
  - "Cindy: I\u2019m trying to prepare for my speech here, if you don\u2019t mind.
    \ "
  - "Player: I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019ve come to warn you of an attempt on your
    life. Or, at least your comfort.  "
  - 'Cindy: What do you mean? '
  - "Player: Annelius, that guy from earlier in the week, planned to pull a prank
    on you today and tried to get me involved with it. But I didn\u2019t really want
    to go along with it, so I came to warn you. "
  - 'Cindy: Really? Well, thank you, I guess. '
  - "Cindy told her parents about the prank, and they removed the bucket from the
    stage. Annelius\u2019s parents find him and scold him for the attempted prank.
    The rest of the Autumbrella Festival went swimmingly, and, as a thanks for helping
    her, Cindy decides to go trick or treating with you. "
  - SCENE 5 -------------------------------
  - TRUE ENDING -------------------------
  - You and Cindy decide to skip out on the Autumbrella Festival, leaving it behind
    and heading back to the arcade. This time, it was Cindy's idea.
  - After you guys had your fun, you decided to walk Cindy back home and help her
    confront her parents.
  - She talked to them about their expectations and the stress it put her under, and
    how she wanted to be her own person.
  - They were surprisingly understanding. As it turned out, they never really knew
    just how much stress they were putting their daughter under.
  - Afterwards, Cindy thanked you for helping her build up the courage to stand up
    to her parents. She decided she would leave behind her old friend group and go
    trick or treating with you this year.
  - You did it! You found someone to go trick or treating with! Congratulations!
  - GOOD ENDING ------------------------
  - Cindy, as thanks for your help, decided to join you in trick or treating
  - You're glad you didn't have to go trick or treating alone, but feel like you could
    have come out of this with a much stronger friendship if you had made some better
    choices...
  - 
  - BAD ENDING --------------------------
  - 'Annelius blames you for the prank that she fell for, and then he and Cindy go
    trick or treating. '
  - You failed to go trick or treating with Cindy.

#### Target Player Exerience

Players will be tasked with making a new friend to go trick or treating with as the day of Halloween quickly approaches. The game is intended to be whimsical and lighthearted, to instill the feeling of excitement that Halloween gave us as children.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechanic

    -   Talking and decision-making. These mechanics will be used to either increase or decrease your friendship meter with the different characters in the story.

2.  Secondary Mechanics

    -   Players can only have a certain number of interactions per day, so choosing who to interact with can impact the outcome of the story
    -   Walking. Players can walk around a town map to find and talk to the different people, creating a more immersive environment
    -   Background personality stats. These are hidden stats about the player that influence their conversations with certain characters. These are influenced by the decisions they make during their morning routine.
    
3.  Progression

    -   Progression is measured through your interactions. There are two types of progression: Game-World Progression and Relationship Progression.
    -   Game-World Progression. The progression of time within the game. As mentioned above, players are only allowed a certain number of interactions per day, and only have a few days until Halloween(which marks the end of the game). Because of this, you progress through the game regardless of how well you are doing.
    -   Relationship Progression. This is the progression of your friendship with the characters in the game. As mentioned above, this progression is earned through the choices you make in your interactions with these characters. Note that your choices can cause the friendship meter to increase or decrease.

4.  Narrative

    -   You are playing as a kid who is preparing for Halloween at the end of the week. Unfortunately, your best friend has fallen ill, and you no longer have someone to go trick-or-treating with! You only have one week to make a new friend who will go trick-or-treating with you, or else you are doomed to be sad and alone for the rest of your life!

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

The MVI will show off our featured mechanic, as well as testing the viability of some of our secondary mechanics. It will include a very small map and a character who you can have an in-depth interaction with, which will involve dialouge and at least one important decision.

The goal of this MVI is to verify that our collection of mechanics will come together to create an engaging target player experience.

        -   (SPOILER ALERT)At the end of Deltarune, you have the chance to walk around the town and talk to new and familiar characters. It gives the game a feeling of realism and community, which are qualities we want in our game.

        -   Pizza Game is a dating sim created explicitly to parody dating sims. While our game is not a parody, we would like for it to be comedic and are pulling inspiration from its comedic vibe.
